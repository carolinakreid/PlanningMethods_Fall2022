    "The goal for lecture today is to play with a Jupyter Notebook and introduce elements that will help you get familiar with Python as an interactive computational environment for exploring data. The material is presented in an interactive environment that runs within your web browser. It allows presentation of text and graphics to be combined with Python code that can be run interactively. We are looking at a Jupyter notebook now. Note that Jupyter is a relatively recent name for this so sometimes you may still see it referred to as an IPython noteboook. Jupyter is just the new version of IPython notebooks, but now also supports a variety of other languages and tools.\n",

A correlation coefficient of .4 is considered a \"strong\" correlation (anything above a .3 is meaningful).\n",

    "\n",
    "When official agencies run a survey (like CHIS, PUMS, AHS, and NHTS), they often include weights that allow the user to calculate total population estimates from survey responses as well as to reduce survey bias. Simply, weighting assists in making our sample of survey respondents (more) representative of the population.  The weighting process usually involves three steps: (i) obtain the design weights, which account for sample selection; (ii) adjust these weights to compensate for nonresponse; (iii) adjust the weights so that the estimates coincide to some known totals of the population, which is called calibration.\n",

But, it is useful to explore how using weights in descriptive statistics can change your results.\n",
